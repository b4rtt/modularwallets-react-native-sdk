	1.	File: ios/CircleModule.m
Change: In the method signature for sendUserOperation:(NSString *)accountAddress to:(NSString *)to value:(NSString *)value ..., rename the parameter accountAddress to accountId. This is to stay consistent with how CircleModuleSwift is actually using the parameter as an internal dictionary key (“accountId”) rather than an Ethereum address.
	2.	File: ios/CircleModuleSwift.swift (Method: sendUserOperationWithAccountAddress)
Change: Rename _ accountId: String or _ accountAddress: String so that it exactly matches the parameter name from Objective-C. Whichever approach you prefer, ensure that your bridging parameter name (accountId in Objective-C) and the Swift parameter name align to avoid confusion.
	3.	File: ios/CircleModuleSwift.swift (Method: createSmartAccountWithClientKey)
Change: When retrieving the stored credential from credentials[credentialId], cast it to the correct type (WebAuthnCredential). Right now, it is an Any, but you need to confirm it’s the WebAuthnCredential that toWebAuthnAccount(...) expects, or else a runtime error may occur.
	4.	File: ios/CircleModuleSwift.swift (Method: sendUserOperationWithAccountAddress)
Change: Wrap the call to UnitUtils.parseEtherToWei(value) in a try block and properly handle potential parse errors. That method can throw if the user’s input is invalid, so you should catch that exception and reject the React Native promise with an appropriate error message.
	5.	File: src/index.ts (JS API Documentation Section)
Change: Expand on the fact that accountId is an internal plugin identifier, not an on-chain address. In the docstring or explanation for sendTransaction, highlight that accountId references a stored object key, and the actual wallet address is returned from createSmartAccount as address.
	6.	File: examples/ExpoUsage.tsx (or wherever you demonstrate usage)
Change: Adjust any references to “accountAddress” or “address” if you’re passing the ephemeral ID from createSmartAccount calls. Clarify that the ephemeral ID is used to look up the correct account object in the iOS bridging layer, while the actual blockchain address is stored under the address field.
	7.	File: ios/CircleModule.m (Method Signatures other than sendUserOperation)
Change: If you also want method signatures for createSmartAccount or others to read “accountId” consistently, audit them for any mismatch. Confirm that the parameter naming across Objective-C, Swift, and JavaScript is uniform for every function that references the ephemeral ID vs. real chain address.
	8.	File: ios/CircleModuleSwift.swift (Memory Management)
Change: After verifying everything works, confirm if you intend to remove references from bundlerClients and smartAccounts once an account is no longer needed. If you require that ephemeral ID to persist only temporarily, introduce a way to delete or unset them. This prevents unbounded growth of dictionaries if you create many accounts.
